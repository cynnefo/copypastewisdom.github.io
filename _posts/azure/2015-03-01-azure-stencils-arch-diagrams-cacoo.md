We often make cloud architecture diagrams and here at [Minjar](http://www.minjar.com/), [Cacoo](https://cacoo.com) is the tool we all love. Its easy to use, there are a couple of AWS stencils already available. Once we started doing architecture diagrams for Micorosft Azure, we started looking for stencils. We found a few icon sets on ever resourceful [Keith Mayer's blog](http://blogs.technet.com/b/keithmayer/archive/2014/10/06/tools-for-building-professional-cloud-architecture-diagrams.aspx) but they were for Microsoft Visio, of which I am not a great fan. It turns out [draw.io](draw.io) already has Azure stencils and we gave it a shot. But working with draw.io is not as fun as working with Cacoo. So I decided to go ahead and create a stencil for Azure using the icons I found via Kieth's blog. It took about 2 hours to import those images one by one, resize them etc, but it was worth it. I have published the stencil on Cacoo store and you can start using from [here](https://cacoo.com/store/items/10512) for free.

Here is one of the architecture diagrams I built using that stencil:
